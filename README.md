My first React Native project. It is an alarm/reminder app. I tried to include as many libraries and modules in this project as I could and mainly focused on understanding how the React Native framework operates. The codebase is messy because it was my first attempt at making an app.


It is currently non-functional because the SweetAlert module keeps crashing the app when called. Log-in page still works if the right credentials are entered.

Here are some previews of the app:
